Arthimethic Operator :

+ , - , *

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-operators-in-shell-scripting/

For String:

var1="srini"
var2="amar"

equal:

[ $var1 = $var2 ]

not equal:

[ $var2 != $var2 ]

empty string:

[ -z var1 ]


Conditions:

a=6
b=8

if (($a > $b)) &&  (($a > $b)) || (($a > $b))
then
   ......
else 
   ......
fi

for the If conditions inside the two circiular brackers only we need to use the variable with $

for Loop :

for var1 in $array
do
echo "$var1"
done

var1 is local variable 

$array is array of values

while & until loop:

In while loop the loop will run if the condition is true.
while contions
do
........
done

In until loop the loop will untill the condition is false.
until condition
do
.........
done

Functions :

function_name(){

........

#parameters to functions are $1 , $2 .... $n

#to access all the parameret at once $* or $@
}

call function:

function_name 1 2 3 4

here 1 2 3 4 are function parameters.
